baseline:
  window_size: 120    # Learned: Longer window for stability
  use_ewma: true      # Learned: EWMA is better for this noise profile

deviation:
  zscore_threshold: 3.5  # Learned: Higher threshold to reduce false positives

persistence:
  min_consecutive_points: 5  # Learned: Stricter persistence
  min_fraction_of_window: 0.5
